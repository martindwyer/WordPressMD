                <p>
                    Martin and Rose came across North Park as part of their search for moose in North America. Not only did they find a rapidly growing collection of moose, but on their hikes they found a natural treasure of wildlife. One hike, they walked past a black bear snoozing under a nearby tree. On another, they walked upon a moose. Another, a coyote. Their fascination has led them to several return trips.
